            {/* Privacy policy */}
            <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

            <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for our website at HTTPS://APP.CROWDWAVE.AI (the "Site"), through which we offer an AI-Powered Audience Simulator software application operated by Avenue Group Ventures Inc.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to issuing an e-mail to the e-mail address listed by registered users or posting the revised Policy on this page or elsewhere on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user, review this site and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.</p>

            <h3>1. What information do we collect from you?</h3>

            <p>In order to better provide you with our services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Site.</p>
            <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>&nbsp; This refers to specific information about you and your organization. This information may include without limitation your first and last name, email address, physical address, and your payment or bank account information, if applicable.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>&nbsp; This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual or organization. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.</p>
            <h3>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</h3>
            <p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you or your organization unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you register for a user account/profile to utilize our services, for example.</p>
            <p>In addition, we may also collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information to diagnose problems with our systems/software and to gather demographic information.</p>
            <p>We will use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you. For example, we will use your information to create your user account and enable you to utilize the many features we make available to subscribers of our platform. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our Site and software applications, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze the Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our Site's content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices and regarding product or service offerings which we believe may be of interest to you. You will be given an opportunity to opt out of receiving promotional materials from us. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you. While you may opt-out of receiving our promotional communications by taking the measures outlined in such communications, you may not opt-out of receiving administrative communications. </p>
            <p>We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our website through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement" target="_blank">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
            <h3>3. With whom do we share your information?</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We may utilize the services of third parties and provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties, and to facilitate such arrangements we reserve the right to share with such third parties Personally Identifiable Information, provided that such third party agree to not share the information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we reserve the right to utilize your information to contact you about products or services we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
            <p>We recognize the sensitive and confidential nature of the information you provide through your use of the Site, including interactions with our AI platform. While we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of such user inputs, we may share user inputs with OpenAI and potentially other future service providers through standard APIs to facilitate the services provided. We do not share your data with any other external parties, except as explicitly agreed upon by you or as required by law. All user inputs are treated as confidential information, and we implement industry-standard measures to protect against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of such information. </p>
            <p>While we uphold the utmost confidentiality of your data inputs, we reserve the right to utilize this information internally to enhance the functionality and performance of the Site and the software featured on it. This includes analyzing user interactions and queries to develop better features, refine AI algorithms, and ensure a more effective and personalized user experience.</p>
            <p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, or if we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
            <p>We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
            <h3>4. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</h3>
            <p>We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in your account at any time by logging on to your account and updating your profile/information.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Site/App. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.</p>
            <h3>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?</h3>
            <p>We may occasionally send you direct mail (including e-mail) about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. You will have the ability to opt out of receiving such communications from us by following the instructions in such communications. </p>
            <h3>6. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</h3>
            <p>Your Personally Identifiable Information is secure on the Site, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Personally Identifiable Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only our selected personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your Personally Identifiable Information to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Accordingly, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, while our systems utilize industry-standard security measures, we will not be liable for security or data breaches that circumvent such security measures.  </p>

            <h3>7. Do we use "cookies"?</h3>

            <p>When you use our Site we will store cookies on your computer/device in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Site/App. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your device's hard drive that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and other information relating to your use of our Site. The cookies make your use of the Site easier, make them run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly in that case.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please contact us by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:contact@crowdwave.ai">contact@crowdwave.ai</a></p>

                    <p>While Provider upholds the utmost confidentiality of Customer inputs, Provider reserve the right to utilize this information internally to enhance the functionality and performance of its Software. This includes analyzing user interactions and queries to develop better features, refine AI algorithms, and ensure a more effective and personalized user experience.</p>
